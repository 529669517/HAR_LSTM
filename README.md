Introduction
------------

The module trains a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to classify human activities based on smartphone sensors information only. 

The Human Activity Recognition (HAR) dataset [1] is available in the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The dependency requirement of running the code (lstm.py) is available in the "reqlstm.txt" file.
